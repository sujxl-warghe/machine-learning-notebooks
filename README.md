# 🤖 ML Practice — My Machine Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning practice repository!**  
Here I document everything I learn while working with **Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning** — using real datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and different ML models.

This repo is focused on **learning by doing** 💡  
I experiment → observe → improve → repeat 🚀

## 📘 Topics I’m Practicing

### 🧮 NumPy
- Arrays, indexing & broadcasting  
- Mathematical & statistical operations  

### 🐼 Pandas
- DataFrames & Series  
- Cleaning and preprocessing data  
- GroupBy, filtering & aggregation  

### 📊 Matplotlib
- Line, bar & scatter plots  
- Styling & visualization techniques  

### 🤖 Scikit-Learn
- Train–Test Split  
- Regression & Classification  
- Model evaluation  
- Saving models (`.pkl`)

## 🧪 Saved Models
Some example trained models stored in `/model`:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- RFC models  

I use them to **reload & reuse models** without retraining.

## 🎯 My Goal With This Repo
✔ Build a **strong ML foundation**  
✔ Practice with real-world datasets  
✔ Understand concepts — not just code  
✔ Create reusable notebooks & models  
✔ Track my learning progress publicly

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Python • NumPy • Pandas • Matplotlib • Scikit-Learn • Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🙏 Credits
Some exercises are **inspired by online ML courses and tutorials**,  
but all notebooks are **modified, organized & documented by me for learning purposes.**
